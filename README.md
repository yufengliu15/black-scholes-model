# black-scholes-model
Trying to replicate the Black-Scholes Model. It is worth noting that I have zero knowledge on finance.

Recall the definitions of a Call and Put Price. 

Call Price: means to spend money (Call Price) to gurantee that you can buy it at that price (strike price) later on (Time to Maturity). If the price goes up, you did well, if the price goes down, you messed up. 

Put Price: means to spend money (Put Price) to gurantee that you can sell (strike price) it at that price later on (Time to Maturity).

In general, the more volatile the option is, the more the Call/Put price is, which intuitively makes sense. 

With the Call Price, the more the spot price is, the more expensive the call price is. This makes sense, since you are guranteeing yourself more money than if you were to get a lower spot price. 

With the Put Price, the more the spot price is, the cheaper it will be since since selling it will be less worth it.
